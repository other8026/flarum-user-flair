# User Flair

Experimenting with making a Flarum extension. It's incomplete and may never be completed. Why?

- No point in doing it this way. Using Flarum's built in groups makes much more sense than adding a group then a flair when they can be the same thing.
- The parts of the forum that I want to modify aren't easily modified (I had to override and copy + paste methods instead of extend them)
- This approach is much better: https://github.com/datlechin/flarum-traditional-rank-icons/ (though I'd like a fallback flair for all regular users, so maybe it's worth it to extend it)
